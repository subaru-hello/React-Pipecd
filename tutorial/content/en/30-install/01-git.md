1. Create a new empty **private** repository in your GitHub account. Any name is fine.

2. Clone the original repository into your local working directory.
    ```console
    git clone https://github.com/pipe-cd/tutorial.git
    ```

3. Push it to the remote private repository.
    ```console
    git remote add private <YOUR_PRIVATE_REPOSITORY_URL>
    git push -u private main
    ```
